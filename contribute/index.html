                as a resource to educate and spread awareness regarding the police brutality crisis that affects Black
                lives worldwide. This website will provide racism on how to combat and educate yourself on the

            <h2>Contribute to Protect Black Lives</h2>
            <h3>Want to contribute to this project?</h3>
            <p>There are so many options! First off, thank you so much for wanting to participate in this project. This collection of resources
              couldn't exist without the help of people like you. Check out our <a href="#submission">Submission Guidelines</a> if this is your first time. Protect Black Lives is an open source project. That means that if you're a developer
              of any skill level, you can contribute. If you aren't a developer, you can still help out!</p>
            <h2>For Non-Developers</h2>
            <p>
              Want to help, but you don't code? No problem! Use <a href="https://forms.gle/sMTRUnXhTj4hdm127" target="_blank">this form</a>
              to submit your resource. Please allow at least 24 hours for your submission to be processed and added.
            </p>
            <h2>For Developers</h2>
              <p>If you don't have a resource but you just want to help, feel free to submit a <b>pull request</b> for any bugs and overall suggestions.
                Even if it's something as simple as a typo, let us know!</p>
              <p>If you have a resource you would like to add, the approach is pretty straight forward! Once you're all set up and ready to submit a
                <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request" target="_blank">pull request</a> 
                to the <a href="https://github.com/emmy-html/pbl" target="_blank">project repository</a>, follow along with these instructions.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Grab the link to the resource you want to add. Make sure this is a direct link to your content.</li>
                <li>After forking the repo, create a new branch for your changes. When naming, use the format <span class="code-sample">[username-resource]</span></li>
                <li>Go to the directory that matches the <b>type</b> of resource you are adding. For example, I'm adding a <b>donation</b>
                  resource, so I will go to <b>donate/index.html</b>.</li>
                <li>CTRL + F to find <span class="code-sample">p class="filterLink"</span><br>
                    When you get there, you'll see the code you need to add your resource. Add the link, and change the title accordingly.<br>
                    Make sure you're adding your resource to the <b>top</b> of the container, <span class="code-sample">filter-content-container</span>.</li>
                <li>Figure out what category and topic(s) your resource belongs to. Here, we filter things by <b>two</b> criteria.<br>
                    The <b>type</b> of resource (Donate, Educate, Heal, Petition, or Protest)<br>
                    And the <b>topics</b> that resource covers. These are the options that you see on the page that allows you to filter through resources.<br>
                    If you have a resource that has multiple types, feel free to add it to both files.</li>
                <li>By now, you've probably noticed the <span class="code-sample">span</span> element for the filter buttons. These will allow people to
                find your resource once you've added it. Add the appropriate tags according to the <b>topics</b> you identified in step 5.<br>
                * If your topic doesn't exist, feel free to create a new one with an appropriate name!</li>
                <li>Add a comment <b>above</b> your resource that says <span class="code-sample">Submitted by [your name]</span></li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                  You're done! Submit your pull request and wait for approval.

            <h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Generally, most submissions will be accepted as long as they are <b>not</b> hate content, sent with malicious intent 
              and/or plagiarized.</p>
            <p>In light of recent events involving peaceful protestors' photos being spread with malicious intent,
              we take extra precaution to protect them. Resources that include details regarding location
              of protests and meetups will not be shared because it's been deemed unsafe. If you would like to read more,
              check out the resources in the <a href="../protest/index.html" target="_blank">Protestor Tech</a> section.</p>
